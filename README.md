      - Scatter plots

      - Histograms

      - Plot customization (titles, labels, grids)

🔹 pokemon.csv

      - Sample dataset used in examples

      - A real-world dataset used primarily in Pandas and Matplotlib examples.
      
      -  Contains Pokémon statistics such as:
         Name
         Type
         HP, Attack, Defense
         Speed and other attributes

🔹 README.md

    - Main documentation file for the repository

    - Provides an overview of the project purpose and learning goals

    - Explains the folder structure and contents of each directory

    - Describes the dataset (pokemon.csv) and its usage

    - Includes instructions on how to run and use the examples
